# Conjoint Example

This repository is set up as a working example of how to deploy a conjoint survey through formr. Using a simple design seen in /design/ and deploying on formr with the settings from /formr/

After collecting the survey data, the choice data can be modelled following framework scripts from /analysis/ with focus on hierarchical Bayes mixed logit model estimation. Also, a demonstration of simulation in the share of preference space.
